    Are you ready to Rebble? You can <strong><a href="https://boot.rebble.io/">get started now</a></strong>!
    Before you go through, you might want to consider supporting us and <strong>purchasing a
    <a href="{{ url_for('billing.account_info') }}">weather and dictation subscription</a></strong>.</p>
    <p>If you do so later, you'll have to repeat the getting started steps. They only take a minute,
    but you may as well save spending a minute twice!
